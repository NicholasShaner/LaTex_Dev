\section*{Problem 1}

Indicate whether the two functions are equal. If the two functions are not equal, then give an element of the domain on which the two functions have different values.\\
 \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
   \item
\[ f: \Z \to \Z, \text{ where } f(x)= x^2.\]
\[ g: \Z \to \Z, \text{ where } g(x)= |x|^2.\]\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
These two functions are \textbf{EQUAL}. As $x^2$, where x is an integer in $\mathbb{Z}$, will always produce an even number, 
evaluating the absolute value of integer $x$ then squaring will also produce the same result. For example:\\
$$(-3)^2 = 9$$
$$|-3|^2 \equiv 3^2 = 9$$
\\\\
\item  \[ f: \Z\times \Z \to \Z, \text{ where } f(x,y)= |x+y|.\]
\[ g: \Z\times \Z \to \Z, \text{ where } g(x,y)= |x|+|y|.\]\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
These two funcion are \textbf{NOT EQUAL}. Assuming integers $x$ and $y$ in domain $\mathbb{Z}$, where $x \neq 0, y \neq 0$,
if ($x < 0$ and $y > 0$) or ($y < 0$ and $x > 0$) then functions will not be equal. For example: if $x = -3$ and $y = 2$:\\
$$f(x,y) = |-3 + 2|\,=\,|-1|\,=\,1$$
$$g(x,y) = |-3|+|2|\,=\,3+2\,=\,5$$
\\\\
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Problem 2}

The domain and target set of functions f and g is $\mathbb{R}$. The functions are defined as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $f(x) = 2x + 3$\\

  \item $g(x) = 5x + 7$\\


\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item  $f\circ g$?\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
$f\circ g$ = $2(5x+7)+3$ = $(10x+14)+3$ = $10x + 17$
\\\\
\item  $g \circ f$?\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
$g \circ f$ = $5(2x+3) + 7$ = $(10x+15) + 7$ = $10x+22$
\\\\
\item  $(f\circ g)^{-1}$?\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
$(f \circ g)^{-1}$ represents the inverse of ($f \circ g$)\\
Previously evaluated, ($f \circ G$) = $10x+17$\\
($f \circ g)^{-1} \Rightarrow$\; $y = 10x+17 \Rightarrow x = 10y+17 \Rightarrow x-17 = 10y \Rightarrow \frac{x-17}{10}$
\\\\
Therefore, ($f \circ g)^{-1} = \frac{x-17}{10}$ 
\\\\
\item  $f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}$?\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
$f = 2x+3 \rightarrow\\
f^{-1} = y=2x+3\; \rightarrow\; x=2y+3\; \rightarrow\; x-3=2y\; \Rightarrow\; y=\bf{\frac{x-3}{2}}$\\
$g = 5x+7 \rightarrow\\
g^{-1} = y=5x+7\; \rightarrow\; x=5y+7\; \rightarrow\; x-7=5y\; \Rightarrow\; y=\bf{\frac{x-7}{5}}$\\
Therefore:\\
($f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}) = \frac{\frac{x-7}{5}-3}{2} = \frac{(x-7)-15}{10} = \bf{\frac{x-22}{10}}$
\\\\
\item  $g^{-1}\circ f^{-1}$?\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
Using the above evaluations:\\
($g^{-1} \circ f^{-1}) = \frac{\frac{x-3}{2}-7}{5} = \frac{(x-3)-14}{10} = \bf{\frac{x-17}{10}}$
\\\\
\end{enumerate}
Are any of the above equal?\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
\textbf{YES}. In the evaluations above, ($f \circ g)^{-1} \equiv (g^{-1} \circ f^{-1}) \equiv \frac{x-17}{10}$\\
\\\\
Proof:\\
Let $h = (f \circ g)^{-1}$\\\\
Then: $(f \circ g) \circ h = x \rightarrow ((f \circ g)\circ(f \circ g)^{-1}) = x \equiv f(g(h(x)))=x$\\\\
$f^{-1}(f(g(h(x))))= f^{-1}(x)\; \equiv\; g(h(x)) = f^{-1}(x)$\\\\
$g^{-1}(g(h(x))) = g^{-1}(f^{-1}(x)) \equiv h(x) = g^{-1}(f^{-1}(x))$\\\\
Substituting $h$ and expanding the right hand side of equation:\\\\
$h(x) = g^{-1}(f^{-1}(x))\; \equiv\; (f \circ g)^{-1} = (g^{-1} \circ f^{-1})$
\\\\

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item The domain of the relation $L$ is the set of all real numbers. For $x$, $y \in \Real, \; xLy$ if $x < y$.\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
Anti-reflexive:\\
If ($x = y$), then does not satisfy the theorem ($x < y$)\\\\

Anti-symmetric:\\
If ($x<y$), then $y$ can not be less than $x$\\\\

Transitive:\\
If ($x<y$) and ($y<z$) then ($x<z$)
\\\\

\item The domain of the relation $A$ is the set of all real numbers. $xAy$ if $|x-y| \leq 2$\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
Reflexive:\\
$\forall x (x=y) \rightarrow |x-y| < 2$\\\\

Sometimes Symmetric:\\
When $y=(x+1)$ or $y=(x-1)$, then $|x-y|<2$ and $|y-x|<2$\\
(ie. $|3-2| = |2-3| = 1$)\\\\

Not Transitive:\\
For all instances of $|x-y|$, if $y<|x-1|$ or $y>|x+1|$ then theorem is not satisfied.\\
(ie. $3-2 < 2$ and $4-3 < 2$, however $4-2 \geq 2$)
\\\\

\item The domain of the relation $Z$ is the set of all real numbers. $xZy$ if $y=2x$\\\\\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
\vspace*{0.5in}\\
Anti-reflexive:\\
For all $x$ and $y$ in $R$, no values exists where $x=2x$\\\\

Anti-symmetric:\\
For every pair $(x,y)$, $xRy \neq yRx$\\\\

Not Transitive:\\
If $y=2x$ and $z=2y$, then there does not exist any instance where $z=2x$\\\\

\section*{Problem 5}

The number of watermelons in a truck are all weighed on a scale. The scale rounds the weight of every watermelon to the nearest pound. The number of pounds read off the scale for each watermelon is called its measured weight. The domain for each of the following relations below is the set of watermelons on the truck. For each relation, indicate whether the relation is:
\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reflexive, anti-reflexive, or neither
  \item Symmetric, anti-symmetric, or neither
  \item Transitive or not transitive
\end{itemize}
Justify your answer.\\

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Watermelon $x$ is related to watermelon $y$ if the measured weight of watermelon $x$ is at least the measured weight of watermelon $y$. No two watermelons have the same measured weight.\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
Since it is stated that no two watermelons have the same weight, $xRx$ will never be true. Therefore, the relation is \textbf{Anti-reflexive}\\\\
As $x>y$, then $y\not>x$ and relation cannot be symmetric. Additionally, as no two watermelons are the same weight, $x\neq y$ and the relationship cannot be anti-symmetric. Therefore the relation is \textbf{Neither}.\\\\
As each pair of watermellons is evaluated individually, then $x>y$ and $y>z$ which means that $x>z$, therefore the relation is \textbf{Transitive}\\ 
\\\\
\item Watermelon $x$ is related to watermelon $y$ if the measured weight of watermelon $x$ is at least the measured weight of watermelon $y$. All watermelons have exactly the same measured weight.\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
Since every element is the same weight, then watermellon $x$ weighs at least as much as itself. Therefore, the relation is \textbf{Reflexive}.\\\\
Again, since every watermelon has the same weight, then $xRy$ and $yRx$ are both valid, and therefore the relation is \textbf{Symmetric}.\\\\
Lastly, once again, since all elements of the relation are the same weight, then $x\geq y$ and $y\geq z$ implies $x\geq z$, therefore the relation is \textbf{Trasitive}.\\
\\\\

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Which vertices can reach vertex 2 by a walk of length 3?\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
Observing the third power matrix $A^3$, column 2, there are values of $1$ in rows 4 and 5 which indicate that vertices $4$ and $5$ can reach vertex $2$ by a walk of length 3.\\
\\\\

\item Is there a walk of length 4 from vertex 4 to vertex 5 in $G$? (Hint: $A^4 = A^2\cdot A^2$.)\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
To find adjacency matrix $A^4$, first need to multiple: $A^2 * A^2$:\\\\
\[
A^4  = \left( \begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1
\end{array} \right)
\]
\\\\
Observing column 4 of the matrix $A^4$ there is a $0$ in row 5. This indicates that there is no walk of length 4 from vertex 4 to vertex 5.\\

\section*{Problem 8}

Determine whether each relation is an equivalence relation. Justify your answer. If the relation is an equivalence relation, then describe the partition defined by the equivalence classes.\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item The domain is a group of people. Person $x$ is related to person $y$ under relation $M$ if $x$ and $y$ have the same favorite color. You can assume that there is at least one pair in the group, $x$ and $y$, such that $xMy$.\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
Since everyones favorite color is the same as their own favorite color, $xRx$ is valid meaning the relation is \textbf{Reflexive}.\\\\
Since the relationships are determined solely on a person's favorite color, then $xMy$ then $yMx$ which shows the relation is \textbf{Symmetric}.\\\\
Again, as the relationships are determined solely on the favorite colors, then if person x has the same favorite color as person y, and person y has the same favorite color as person z then inheritantly person x has the same favorite color as person z.
$xMy \land yMz \rightarrow xMz$, which means that the relation is \textbf{Transitive}.\\\\
Since the relation is \textbf{Reflexive, Symmetric, and Transitive}, then the relation is equivalence relation. The partition classes are each group of all individuals sharing a matching favorite colors. As each individual can only have one favorite color, the union of all groups is all the people in the group.
\\\\

\item The domain is the set of all integers. $xEy$ if $x + y$ is even. An integer $z$ is even if $z = 2k$ for some integer $k$.\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
Whether even or odd, each integer satisfies $xEx$:\\
$x+x = 2x$ which is even.\\
$2x+1$ is odd, whereas if y is odd, $y+y = (2x+1)+(2x+1) = 4x+2 \Rightarrow 2(2x+1)$, as a product of 2, $2$ times any integer is even. Therefore, any integer added to itself is even, and $xEx$ is valid for all relations which means the relation is \textbf{Reflexive}.\\\\
For any pair of integers, if $x+y$ is even, then $y+x$ is even, therefore the relation is \textbf{Symmetric}.\\\\
Let $x+y$ be an even integer $2m$ then $x=2m-y$, and $y+z$ be an even integer $2n$ then $z=2n-y$. This means $x+z=2n-y+2m-y \Rightarrow 2n+2m-2y \rightarrow 2(m+n-y)$. Any product of an integer times an even number is even, therefore $x+z$ is even and the relation is \textbf{Transitive}.\\
\vspace*{0.1in}
\\\\\
Since the relation is \textbf{Reflexive, Symmetric, and Transitive}, then the relation is equivalence relation. The partition classes are all even integers, and all odd integers. Since every integer can only be even or odd, the union of both partition classes is all integers.
\\\\

\end{enumerate}
