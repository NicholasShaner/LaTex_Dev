\section*{Problem 1}
 \noindent
 This question has 2 parts.
 \subsection*{Part 1:}
 Suppose that $F$ and $X$ are events from a common sample space with $P(F) \neq 0$ and $P(X) \neq 0$.
 \\
 \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
     \item Prove that $P(X) = P(X|F)P(F) + P(X|\bar{F})P(\bar{F})$. Hint: Explain why $P(X|F)P(F) = P(X \cap F)$ is another way of writing the definition of conditional probability, and then use that with the logic from the proof of Theorem 4.1.1.
     \\\\
     %Enter your answer below this comment line.
     Using the definition of conditional probability:\\
     $$p(X|F) = \frac{p(X \cap F)}{p(F)}$$
     Multiply both sides by $p(F)$:\\
     $$p(X|F)p(F) = p(X \cap F)$$\\
     The same definition appplies to the conditional probability of $\overline{F}$:\\
     $$p(X|\overline{F}) = \frac{X \cap \overline{F}}{p(\overline{F})}$$
     $$p(X|\overline{F})p(\overline{F}) = p(X \cap \overline{F})$$\\
     Since the law of total probability states:\\
     $$p(X) = p(X \cap F) + p(X \cap \overline{F})$$\\
     Substituting the conditional probabilities proves:\\
     $$p(X) = p(X \cap F) + p(X \cap \overline{F})\;=\;p(X|F)p(F)\,+\,p(X|\overline{F})p(\overline{F})$$
     \\\\
     \item Explain why $P(F|X) = P(X|F)P(F)/P(X)$ is another way of stating Theorem 4.2.1 Bayesâ€™ Theorem.
     \\\\
     %Enter your answer below this comment line.
     Bayes' Theorem states:\\
     $$p(F|X)=\frac{p(X|F)p(F)}{p(X|F)p(F)+p(X|\overline{F})p(\overline{F})}$$\\
     Using the definitions of probability previously evaluated:\\
     $$p(X|F)p(F) = p(X \cap F)$$
     And:\\\\
     $$p(X|\overline{F})p(\overline{F}) = p(X \cap \overline{F})$$\\\\
     \vspace{0.2in}
     Therefore, Bayes' Theorem equivalent to:\\
     $$p(F|X)=\frac{p(X \cap F)}{p(X \cap F)+p(X \cap \overline{F})}$$\\
     \\\\
     As $F$ and $\overline{F}$ are mutually exclusive and $F+\overline{F}=1$, the denominator can be expressed:\\
     $$p(X \cap F)+p(X \cap \overline{F})=p((X \cap F)\cup (X \cap \overline{F}))=p(X)$$\\
     Therefore, substituting the equivalencies found back into the original equation:\\
     $$p(F|X) = \frac{p(X \cap F)}{p(X)} \equiv \frac{p(F|X)p(F)}{p(X)}$$
     \\\\
 \end{enumerate}
 \subsection*{Part 2:}
 A website reports that 70\% of its users are from outside a certain country. Out of their users from outside the country, 60\% of them log on every day. Out of their users from inside the country, 80\% of them log on every day.
 \\
 \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item What percent of all users log on every day? Hint: Use the equation from Part 1 (a).
 \\\\
 %Enter your answer below this comment line.
 Using the equation from Part 1 (a):\\
 $$p(X)\,=\,p(X|F)p(F)\,+\,p(X|\overline{F})p(\overline{F})$$\\
 Substituting the given information:\\
 $$p(X)\,=\,(0.6 * 0.7) + (0.8 * 0.3)\,=\,0.42\,+\,0.24\,=\,0.66$$\\
 \begin{center}Therefore:\end{center}
 \vspace{0.1in}
 $$p(X)\,=\,0.66\,=\,66\%$$\\
 {\Large \bf 66\%} of all users log on every day.
 \\\\
 \item Using Bayesâ€™ Theorem, out of users who log on every day, what is the probability that they are from inside the country?
 \\\\
 %Enter your answer below this comment line.
 Substituting the known values evaluated in the previous questions:\\
 $$p(F|X)=\frac{p(X|F)p(F)}{p(X|F)p(F)+p(X|\overline{F})p(\overline{F})}$$
 $$p(F|X)=\left ( \frac{0.24}{0.66}\right )$$
 $$p(F|X)=0.\overline{36}$$
 Therefore, there is a {\Large \bf 36\%} probability of the users who log on every day being from inside the country.
 \end{enumerate}

  \section*{Problem 3}
  A car dealership sells cars that were made in 2015 through 2020. Let the cars for sale be the domain of a relation R where two cars are related if they were made in the same year.

  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Prove that this relation is an equivalence relation.
\\\\
  %Enter your answer below this comment line.
  To prove an equivalence relation, reflexivity, symmetry, and transivity need to be proven.\\
  In the given relationship:\\
  - Since each car built in a certain year can be related to itself, ($aRa$) is confirmed and the relationship is reflexive.\\
  - Since multiple cars are created within the same year, car $x$ is related to car $y$ ($xRy$), and car $y$ is related to car $x$ (yRx), therefore the relationship is symmetric.\\
  - As multiple cars are made each year, car $x$ is related to car $y$ ($xRy$), and car $y$ is related to car $z$ ($yRz$), therefore car $x$ is related to car $z$ ($xRz$), meaning the relationship is transitive.\\
  Since all three conditions are upheald, the relationship is an equivalence relation.
\\\\
    \item Describe the partition defined by the equivalence classes.
\\\\
  %Enter your answer below this comment line.
  The equivalencies classes would be the subsets of all cars made within the same year. The partition created is each of these subsets by manufacturing year 
  and the union of all subsets would be equivalent to the entire domain of all vehicles for sale.

  }
}\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
Examining the undirected graph, it can be determined to be an Euler circuit. Each vertice is of degree two, and all edges and vertices can be traced by a 
closed walk starting and ending at the same vertex without repeating any edges.\\
An example walk of an Euler circuit within the graph starting at vertex (a) is:\\\\
$\langle\,a,\, b,\, c,\, a,\, d,\, e,\, b,\, f,\, a\, \rangle$

}
\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
Observing the given graph, is can be seen that exactly 2 vertices have a degree of 3 which is a typical characteristic of an Euler trail in which the same restriction as a circuit are applied but the walk starts and ends at different vertices.\\
An example of a Euler trail within he graph is:\\\\
$\langle \,b,\,a,\,d,\,e,\,b,\,f,\,a,\,c,\,d,\,f\, \rangle$

  }
}
\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
Examining the graph, it is immediately obvious to not have an Euler circuit, or an Euler trail as the graph is {\bf NOT} connected and there are no edges connecting the components.

  }
}
\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
Looking at the suppled graph, again it can be quickly determined to not be a Euler circuit, or Euler trail as the graph has four vertices of odd number degrees (a, b, d, e).\\
Due to this, the graph does not meet the requirement of an Euler circuit where only even degree vertices exist, nor a Euler trail where exactly two vertices exist with odd degrees.

  \section*{Problem 5}
  Use Prim's algorithm to compute the minimum spanning tree for the weighted graph. Start the algorithm at vertex A. Explain and justify each step as you add an edge to the tree.

{\color{blue} {\bf Figure 10:} \emph{A weighted graph shows 5 vertices, represented by circles, and 6 edges, represented by line segments. Vertices A, B, C, and D are placed at the corners of a rectangle, whereas vertex E is at the center of the rectangle. The edges, A B, B D, A C, C D, A E, and E C, have the weights, 7, 3, 2, 4, 5, and 6, respectively.
  }
}
\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
Starting at vertex $A$, the edges incident to the vertex are $(A, B)$, $(A, E)$ and $(A, C)$. With a weighted value of $2$, $(A, C)$ is added.\\
From vertex $C$, the eligible edges incident to the vertex are $(C, D)$ and $(C, E)$. With a lower weighted value of $4$, $(C, D)$ is added.\\
The next lowest weighted eligible edge added is $(D, B)$ with a weight of $3$.\\
Lastly, to incorporate vertex $E$, the lowest weight eligible edge added is $(A, E)$.\\
Therefore, the final list of edges to create the minimum spanning tree is: $\{A, C\}, \{C, D\}, \{D, B\}, \{A, E\}$\\\\
The final computed value of the minimum spanning tree is: {\Large \bf 14}.

  \section*{Problem 6}
A lake initially contains 1000 fish. Suppose that in the absence of predators or other causes of removal, the fish population increases by 10\% each month. However, factoring in all causes, 80 fish are lost each month.\\

Give a recurrence relation for the population of fish after $n$ months. How many fish are there after 5 months? If your fish model predicts a non-integer number of fish, round down to the next lower integer.
\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
The recurrence relation for the population of fish after $n$ months is:\\
$${\bf F(n) = (1.1*F(n-1))-80}$$\\
This calculates 110\% of the previous months total fish population then minus 80 fish for the factored losses per month.\\\\
To calculate for fish population after 5 months:\\\\
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\begin{aligned}
F(0)&=1000\\
F(1)&=(1.1 * 1000)-80 = 1020\\
F(2)&=(1.1 * 1020)-80 = 1042\\
F(3)&=(1.1 * 1042)-80 = 1062.2\\
F(4)&=(1.1 * 1062.2)-80 = 1084.42\\
F(5)&=(1.1*1084.42)-80 = 1102.862\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\\\\
Rounding down to the nearest whole integer, the fish population after 5 months is: {\Large \bf 1102} fish.
